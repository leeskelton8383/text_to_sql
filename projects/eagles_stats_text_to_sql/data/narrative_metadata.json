    "text": "The 2020 season was the Philadelphia Eagles' 88th in the National Football League (NFL) and their fifth and final under head coach Doug Pederson. They failed to improve on their 9\u20137 record from the previous season following a 23\u201317 loss to the Seattle Seahawks in Week 12. They were eliminated from playoff contention for the first time since 2016 following a Week 16 loss to the Dallas Cowboys and finished with a dismal 4\u201311\u20131 record, the second-worst in the National Football Conference (NFC), and their worst since 2012. After starting 3\u20134\u20131 heading into their bye week and leading the NFC East, the Eagles would lose 7 of their last 8 games. Injuries and poor quarterback play were factors in their struggles in the season. On January 11, 2021, the Eagles announced head coach Doug Pederson would not return after the season, as he was dismissed the same day. For the first time since 1998, the Eagles failed to score 30 or more points in a single game the entire season. Their .281 winning percentage was their worst since 2012. Overall, Carson Wentz, statistically, had one of the poorest seasons by a quarterback in franchise history, throwing for 2,620 yards, 16 touchdowns, 15 interceptions, and completed just 57.4% of his passes (251 for 437) to go with his 72.8 passer rating. He also got sacked 50 times for 326 yards. On July 14, 2020, the city of Philadelphia placed a ban on large events for six months, meaning that the Eagles' home games would have no fans in attendance. However, starting in week 6, Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney announced that the city would allow 7,500 fans to attend Eagles home games.

The season also marked the end of the Carson Wentz era in Philadelphia as he was traded to the Indianapolis Colts in the 2021 off-season. As of the 2024 season, this is the most recent season the Eagles missed the playoffs, finished with a losing record, and finished in last place in the NFC East.

As the result of the negative differential of free agent signings and departures that the Eagles experienced during the first wave of the 2019 free agency period, the team is projected to receive two compensatory selections for the 2020 draft. Free agent transactions that occurred after May 7, 2019, did not factor into the team's formula for determining compensatory selections.

Game summaries Week 1: at Washington Football Team In a near-reversal of the previous season's opener, the Eagles scored the first 17 points, only for the Washington Football Team to then shut their offense out for the remainder of the afternoon. Meanwhile, Washington's offense scored 27 unanswered points, and the defense sacked Carson Wentz eight times, recorded two interceptions, and forced three fumbles. With the loss, Philadelphia's six-game winning streak against Washington dating back to 2016 came to an end, and the Eagles lost the first game of the season for the first time since 2015.

An early fumble by Miles Sanders led to a Rams touchdown by Tyler Higbee. After the Eagles cut their deficit to four with a Jake Elliott field goal, Los Angeles responded with a Robert Woods touchdown run followed by a second Higbee touchdown catch. Trailing 21\u20133, the Eagles closed the deficit to five points by halftime with touchdown runs by Wentz and Sanders. After forcing a three-and-out on the Rams' first possession of the second half, the Eagles would drive to the Los Angeles 21, only for Wentz's first down pass to be picked off by Darious Williams, turning the momentum back in the Rams' favor as they would outscore the Eagles 16\u20133 the rest of the way. Despite not being sacked once during the game, Wentz finished the day with a 56.5 passer rating, completing 26 of 43 passes for 242 yards and two interceptions. The 37\u201319 blowout loss dropped Philadelphia to 0\u20132 for the first time since 2015, and marked the Eagles' first home opener loss since that same season. It was also the first home loss to the Rams franchise since 2001. Week 3: vs. Cincinnati Bengals The Eagles welcomed the Cincinnati Bengals to Lincoln Financial Field seeking their first win over Cincinnati since 2000. After a scoreless first quarter, the two teams traded field goals in the second, before the Bengals took a 10\u20136 lead on a touchdown reception by Tee Higgins. Wentz responded on the ensuing drive, as he threw his 100th career touchdown pass to Greg Ward to put the Eagles in front 13\u201310 at halftime. After the Eagles added another Jake Elliott field"

Wentz responded on the ensuing drive, as he threw his 100th career touchdown pass to Greg Ward to put the Eagles in front 13\u201310 at halftime. After the Eagles added another Jake Elliott field goal, the Bengals reclaimed a one-point lead with Higgins' second touchdown of the afternoon. Cincinnati would pad its lead to seven points with two fourth-quarter field goals. Trailing 23\u201316 with just over 3 minutes left in regulation, Philadelphia drove down the field to score the game-tying touchdown on a 7-yard run for Wentz. In overtime, both defenses held strong, with neither team being able to get into field goal range until the final drive, when the Eagles got to the Bengals' 41. However, a costly false start on Matt Pryor brought Philadelphia out of field goal range. The Eagles punted the ball, and the game ended on the following play with the Bengals at their own 20. Despite his milestone, Wentz's struggles continued as he also threw two interceptions for the third straight game and finished the game with a 62.8 passer rating. Philadelphia improved to 0\u20132\u20131 with the tie, but failed to snap their winless streak against Cincinnati and fell to 0\u20133\u20132 in their last five against the Bengals, including an 0\u20132\u20131 mark at Lincoln Financial Field.

Unknown wide receiver Travis Fulgham signed a 1-year contract before the game and caught a key go-ahead score in the 3rd quarter. Linebacker Alex Singleton also scored a touchdown on an interception which proved to be the decider. Week 5: at Pittsburgh Steelers After being the hero the previous week, Travis Fulgham had a breakout game with 10 receptions for 152 yards and a touchdown, but was outperformed by Steelers rookie wide receiver Chase Claypool, who scored 4 total touchdowns, 3 receiving, from 7 catches and 110 yards. The loss dropped the Eagles to 1\u20133\u20131. Week 6: vs. Baltimore Ravens After falling behind 17\u20130 in the first half, the Eagles surged back with a dominant second half to pull within two points of the Ravens in the fourth quarter. However, the furious rally came up short as Carson Wentz was stopped on a would-be game-tying two-point conversion in the final two minutes. Baltimore recovered the ensuing onside kick and ran out the clock to seal the narrow 30\u201328 loss. With their second straight defeat, Philadelphia dropped to 1\u20134\u20131 on the season. This was the first game in the 2020 season where Carson Wentz did not throw an interception and he was praised with the near 4th quarter comeback. Week 7: vs. New York Giants The Eagles recovered from a 21\u201310 hole. They scored 12 unanswered points and reclaimed first place in the NFC East when Boston Scott caught a game-winning touchdown pass and linebacker Brandon Graham forced a fumble on Giants quarterback Daniel Jones. This win improved the Eagles to 2\u20134\u20131. They extended their all-time series lead to 89\u201386\u20132. Week 8: vs. Dallas Cowboys Despite committing four turnovers and being held to a"

Week 8: vs. Dallas Cowboys Despite committing four turnovers and being held to a season-low seven first half points, Wentz and the Eagles bumbled their way to a crucial division win over an injury-ravaged Dallas Cowboys team led by rookie quarterback Ben DiNucci. The Cowboys opened the scoring on the game's opening drive with a 49-yard field goal by Greg Zuerlein. After a fumble by Wentz gave the Cowboys the ball back, the Eagles regained possession on a DiNucci fumble and took a 7\u20133 lead on Jalen Reagor's first career touchdown reception. The Cowboys responded with another Zuerlein field goal following Wentz's second fumble, and took a 9\u20137 halftime lead on a 59-yard field goal (mirroring the halftime score in Dallas in 2017, also played on Sunday Night Football). On the Eagles' second-half opening drive, Wentz would be picked off by Cowboys rookie cornerback Trevon Diggs, who returned the ball to the Dallas 31, but the Cowboys failed to capitalize when Zuerlein's ensuing 52-yard field goal attempt sailed wide right. The Eagles used the momentum swing to regain the lead 15\u20139 on a 9-yard Travis Fulgham touchdown reception. In the fourth quarter, T. J. Edwards strip-sacked DiNucci, and the ensuing fumble was recovered and returned 53 yards for a touchdown by Rodney McLeod.

Week 10: at New York Giants The Eagles came stumbling out of the bye week and suffered their first loss to the Giants since Week 9 of the 2016 season, ending an eight-game winning streak against New York. The Eagles also fell to 1\u20134 after the bye in the Doug Pederson era. This left many fans and media questioning Pederson's play calling creativity. Despite a subpar performance from Wentz, he played his first turnover free game of 2020. The Eagles fell to 3\u20135\u20131, but nonetheless remained in first place in a lowly NFC East. The all-time series fell to 89\u201387\u20132. Week 11: at Cleveland Browns In heavy rain and wind, the Eagles would lose a defensive game. Wentz struggled again, throwing 2 interceptions and absorbing 5 sacks, and Sanders lost a fumble, wasting a good effort by the defense against a high-powered Browns offense. This loss dropped the Eagles to 3\u20136\u20131. Week 12: vs. Seattle Seahawks The Eagles returned home to face the Seattle Seahawks behind closed doors. Philadelphia entered the game winless against Seattle in the Russell Wilson era with an 0\u20135 record. After a scoreless first quarter, the Seahawks would jump to a 14-point lead on touchdowns by David Moore and Chris Carson. A drive led by Carson Wentz at the end of the first half would put the Eagles on the board, but the Seahawks would not relinquish their lead for the remainder of the game. A garbage time Hail Mary from Wentz to Richard Rodgers pulled the Eagles within 6 points, but the Seahawks recovered the ensuing onside kick to seal Philadelphia's third straight loss. This touchdown would be Wentz's last in an Eagles uniform. The Eagles fell to 3\u20137\u20131"

Week 13: at Green Bay Packers This game is noted to be the final start for the 2016 number 2 overall pick QB Carson Wentz with the Philadelphia Eagles. With the loss, the Eagles fall to 3\u20138\u20131, and have sealed their first losing season since 2016. Carson Wentz was benched in favor for Jalen Hurts after the first drive in the third quarter. On December 8, it was announced Jalen Hurts would get the starting nod in favor of Wentz. Week 14: vs. New Orleans Saints Jalen Hurts made his first start in Week 14 as the Eagles stunned the favored Saints and snapped their 9-game winning streak. Hurts and Miles Sanders each ran for over 100 yards on the Saints' top ranked run defense as the Eagles roared out to a 17\u20130 lead at halftime and were able to hold off a late Saints rally to win 24\u201321. This is the first win against the Saints since the 2015 season. Week 15: at Arizona Cardinals Coming off an upset win against the Saints, Jalen Hurts was once again named the starter for Week 15 against the Arizona Cardinals.

The Eagles tied the score at 26 on a 7-yard run by Hurts, however due to an injury to punter Cameron Johnston, Philadelphia was left without a holder. Tight end Zach Ertz served as a backup holder on the extra point attempt, and mishandled a poor snap from long snapper Rick Lovato. Arizona would regain the lead after a successful fake punt, with Murray throwing a go-ahead 20-yard touchdown pass to DeAndre Hopkins. The Eagles attempted a comeback drive with less than 2 minutes left in the 4th quarter but on the final play of the game Jalen Hurts's pass to Goedert was knocked away, sealing the Arizona victory. With the loss, the Eagles fall to 4\u20139\u20131, their most losses in a season since the 2016 Season. Doug Pederson announced Monday that Jalen Hurts would start again for week 16 against the Dallas Cowboys. Week 16: at Dallas Cowboys The game began with the Eagles having an eleven-point first quarter lead after two touchdowns. However, the tides would turn in the second quarter, and the Eagles would massively struggle from there, as their defense gave up 513 total yards and 37 points on the evening. Fletcher Cox suffered a stinger injury in the second quarter which would ultimately cost the Eagles their season.

Week 17: vs. Washington Football Team While Philadelphia was already eliminated when this game was conducted, the game was still relevant to the playoffs; if the Eagles won, then the New York Giants would advance as NFC East champions, while if they lost, then Washington would win the NFC East. The game was scheduled as the final game of the regular season to ensure that the televised Sunday night football game would have playoff implications. Despite erasing an early 10-point deficit, the Eagles lost 20\u201314 to Washington, who clinched the NFC East and the fourth seed as a result. Philadelphia finished with a 4\u201311\u20131 overall record, their worst since the 2012 season, and were swept by Washington for the first time since the 2016 season. This loss also secured a last place finish in the NFC East for the first time since 2016. After the game, coach Doug Pederson was criticized for taking out starting quarterback Jalen Hurts in the fourth quarter for a third-string quarterback with the game still in close contention, a move more associated with preseason games that allegedly shocked the Eagles players.

They improved on their 4\u201311\u20131 record from the previous season after a 40\u201329 win against the New Orleans Saints in Week 11 and returned to the playoffs after a one-year absence. This was the Eagles' first season since 2015 without quarterback Carson Wentz, as he was traded to the Indianapolis Colts in March 2021.

However, things turned around and the Eagles went 7\u20132 in their next 9 games and clinched a playoff berth after a one-year absence.

With the win, the Eagles earn their first win in Denver since 1989 and matched their 2020 win total.

Week 15: vs. Washington Football Team In the week leading up to the game, a COVID-19 outbreak among the Washington Football Team led to postponement of the game originally scheduled for December 19. The game was moved to Tuesday night. On the rare Tuesday Night Football, Washington got off to a quick start after a pair of Eagles turnovers starting from a flukey interception bouncing off of Dallas Goedert's foot to a Jalen Hurts' fumble. From the second quarter on, the Eagles would score 20 unanswered points before surrendering a Washington TD. A late back shoulder throw from Jalen Hurts to Greg Ward would secure the Eagles' victory. This is the first divisional win in the Hurts/Sirianni era and a win that keeps the Eagles alive in the playoff push. Week 16: vs. New York Giants Despite a slow start, the Eagles rallied with 31 second-half points in a 34-10 rout of the shorthanded New York Giants, including a touchdown catch by Lane Johnson and a pick-six by Alex Singleton. This win was Philadelphia's eighth straight home win and 90th overall win over their rivals. Week 17: at Washington Football Team Despite again playing less-than-stellar football to start the game, the Eagles rallied for their fourth straight win, improving to 9-7 on the year and earning their first winning season and playoff appearance since 2019, thanks to wins by the San Francisco 49ers and Green Bay Packers later that day.

Week 18: vs. Dallas Cowboys With a playoff spot already clinched, the Eagles rested Jalen Hurts, who was nursing an ankle injury, and most other key starters in the season finale. The Cowboys, who played nearly all of their key starters, had an offensive attack that was too powerful for the Eagles' backups to handle. The 51\u201326 loss ended the Eagles' regular season with a 9\u20138 record, and the 51 points were the most the Eagles surrendered in a single game at Lincoln Financial Field, surpassing the previous mark of 48 against the New Orleans Saints in 2009. Standings Division Conference Postseason Game summaries NFC Wild Card Playoffs: at (2) Tampa Bay Buccaneers The Eagles travelled to take on the #2 seed and defending Super Bowl champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Tampa Bay would jump out to an early lead and never look back in a 31-15 rout of Philadelphia. The game would mark the first career playoff appearances for Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni and quarterback Jalen Hurts, and would be the final playoff victory for Tampa Bay quarterback Tom Brady. Brady marched the Bucs to two first quarter touchdown drives, while Hurts struggled to move the ball against the Tampa defense.

Dallas Goedert caught six passes for 92 yards, while defensive end Ryan Kerrigan, coming off a disappointing season for the Eagles and playing in his last game as a professional, tallied 1.5 sacks of Brady.

The Eagles started 8\u20130 for the first time in franchise history, before their winning streak was snapped with a 32\u201321 upset loss to the Washington Commanders in Week 10.

With the win, the Eagles started 1\u20130 for the ninth time since 2010 and for the second time under head coach Nick Sirianni.

However, only the Eagles would show off their high powered offense. The Eagles would receive the ball and march down the field finishing with a 3 yard Jalen Hurts touchdown. Kicking off the second quarter, Jalen Hurts would connect with Quez Watkins on a 53 yard touchdown to double Philadelphia's lead to 14\u20130.

In the second half, the Eagles defense would step up and shut down the Vikings offense.

Despite no second half points from either team, the Eagles looked to be the dominant team. The Eagles would go on to win and have their first 2\u20130 start since 2016. Furthermore, this game was by far Jalen Hurts' best performance throwing the ball and claimed by many media members his possible \"breakout game.\" Jalen would finish 26 of 31 for 333 yards 3 total touchdowns and 1 interception with a passer rating of 108.7. Week 3: at Washington Commanders In his first time facing the Eagles since being traded away from them, Carson Wentz was sacked 9 times and the Commanders only had 47 total yards of offense in the first half. Jalen Hurts threw for 300 yards in back-to-back games and threw touchdown passes to Dallas Goedert, A. J. Brown, and DeVonta Smith in the second quarter.

Philadelphia entered the game as the lone unbeaten team in the league following the Miami Dolphins' loss to the Cincinnati Bengals the previous Thursday. The Jaguars jumped out to a quick 14\u20130 lead following a pick six by Andre Cisco and a 4 yard touchdown reception by Jamal Agnew. The Eagles rebounded with a dominant second quarter to take a 20\u201314 lead on touchdown runs by Jalen Hurts, Miles Sanders, and Kenneth Gainwell. The defense would also stymie Jacksonville throughout the game, forcing an interception and four Trevor Lawrence fumbles, including one that snuffed out any hope of a Jaguars comeback. With the 29\u201321 win, the Eagles improved to 4\u20130 for the first time since the 2004 season. Also with this win, Philadelphia defeated Jacksonville for the fourth straight time.

With the stunning loss, the Eagles fell to 8\u20131 and failed to become the first NFL team to start a season 9\u20130 since the Steelers did two seasons ago, who coincidentally also faced their first loss to Washington, who were then the Washington Football Team. Despite this loss, Philadelphia still tied a franchise record for their best start at 8\u20131. Week 11: at Indianapolis Colts This was head coach Nick Sirianni's first return to Indianapolis since leaving the team in January 2021 to become the Eagles' head coach. Sirianni previously served as the Colts' offensive coordinator under then-head coach Frank Reich from 2018 to 2020, appearing in the playoffs twice in that span, and Sirianni's last game was the 2020 AFC Wild Card game, which was a 27\u201324 loss to the Buffalo Bills.

While the Eagles defense gave up 33 points to the Packers, they intercepted Aaron Rodgers twice. Rodgers exited the game in the third quarter due to an injury and was replaced by Jordan Love, who threw a 63-yard touchdown to rookie wide receiver Christian Watson. The Eagles would clinch the victory with a 54-yard field goal from Jake Elliott.

After a shaky start with 2 interceptions, Jalen Hurts would settle in throwing for 315 yards and scoring 3 touchdowns. Those touchdowns would tie an Eagles franchise record for the most total touchdowns (35) by a quarterback in a season. A day after the game, it was revealed that Hurts had sprained his shoulder late in the third quarter. Impressively, Hurts went 6/9 for 102 yards and 104.9 rating with the sprained shoulder, including a rushing touchdown and subsequent 2-point conversion. Week 16: at Dallas Cowboys Backup quarterback Gardner Minshew started the Eagles' road finale against the arch-rival Cowboys in place of Jalen Hurts, who was sitting out due to the shoulder injury he sustained the prior week against Chicago. Despite a solid performance by Minshew, Philadelphia blew two 10\u2013point leads and was doomed by a season-high four turnovers, all of which led to scoring drives for Dallas, in what turned out to be a high-scoring slugfest.

Week 17: vs. New Orleans Saints The Eagles returned home, seeking to clinch the NFC East for the first time since 2019 and the number 1 seed for the first time since 2017. However, they were instead dealt their second straight defeat in a defensive slugfest with a red-hot New Orleans Saints team. After falling behind 13\u20130 at halftime, Philadelphia pulled within three points of New Orleans with a ten-point third quarter, but their momentum would be halted with a Marshon Lattimore pick-six in the fourth quarter.

Standings Division Conference Postseason Schedule Game summaries NFC Divisional Playoffs: vs. (6) New York Giants The Eagles convincingly routed their division rival New York Giants 38\u20137 in their first home playoff victory since the 2017 Super Bowl championship season. New York had won their Wild Card playoff matchup on the road against the Minnesota Vikings, with Daniel Jones turning in arguably his strongest performance as a professional. The Eagles, meanwhile, had lumbered down the stretch, dropping two of their last three games and needing to play starters in Week 18 to finally secure the top seed. Jalen Hurts connected with DeVonta Smith for 40 yards on the second play from scrimmage. Dallas Goedert brought in a pass one-handed for a touchdown to finish the drive. Consecutive sacks by Haason Reddick turned the ball back over to the Eagles, who went up 14\u20130 on a 9-yard touchdown reception by Smith. Former Giant James Bradberry intercepted Jones on New York's ensuing possession. In the second quarter, Boston Scott scored on a 3-yard touchdown run, and Hurts capped off a 14-play drive with a 5-yard touchdown run to push the score to 28\u20130. A third quarter touchdown run by Matt Breida got New York on the board, set up by a 39-yard Saquon Barkley rush.

The Eagles offense produced 268 rushing yards on 44 carries, with Gainwell leading the way at 112 yards, while the defense contributed five sacks. With the victory, the Eagles advanced to the NFC Championship, their first in five seasons. NFC Championship: vs. (2) San Francisco 49ers The Eagles routed the San Francisco 49ers 31\u20137 in the NFC Championship Game. While this was Philadelphia's first appearance in the conference championship since the 2017 season, it was San Francisco's third trip in four years. The 49ers had rolled to a 13\u20134 record and second seed during the season, mostly behind the league's top-ranked defense, but also due to the surprising play of rookie (7th round draft pick) quarterback Brock Purdy. On the opening drive of the game, DeVonta Smith made a diving, one-armed reception on a fourth down play to set up first-and-goal for the Eagles. Replays showed the ball had hit the ground, but the 49ers failed to challenge the play in time. Miles Sanders took a handoff six yards up the middle for a touchdown to make it 7\u20130 Philadelphia. On San Francisco's first possession, Purdy was sacked while in his throwing motion by Haason Reddick. The hit resulted in a fumble recovered by Eagles nose tackle Linval Joseph, and more consequentially, injured Purdy's throwing elbow. Journeyman backup Josh Johnson replaced Purdy, and strong defensive play by each team dominated the rest of the first quarter and into the second quarter. An impressive 29-yard touchdown run, in which he broke four tackles, by Christian McCaffrey tied the game for San Francisco. The Eagles answered immediately with a methodical touchdown drive capped off by a 13-yard scamper into the end zone by Sanders."

The Eagles answered immediately with a methodical touchdown drive capped off by a 13-yard scamper into the end zone by Sanders. With 1:19 left in the half, Johnson lost a fumble on a shotgun, and Boston Scott rushed to the right side for a 10-yard touchdown to make it 21\u20137 Eagles at halftime. On the first series of the third quarter, Johnson was knocked out of the game on a hit by Ndamukong Suh, forcing an injured Purdy back into action. With Purdy unable throw more than about ten yards, the 49ers offense was powerless to mount a credible comeback attempt. Jalen Hurts added a 1-yard rushing touchdown after a 15-play drive late in the third quarter, and Jake Elliott's fourth quarter field goal made it 31\u20137 Eagles. With less than 5 minutes left to play, 49ers All-Pro left tackle Trent Williams slammed Eagles backup safety K'Von Wallace to the ground, causing a brawl between both teams. The 49ers were able to limit Hurts to just 121 passing yards; however, the Eagles ground attack was able to move the ball against the stout San Francisco rushing defense, totaling 148 yards for the day with all four touchdowns coming on the ground. The Eagles defense tallied three sacks and forced three turnovers (all fumbles). With the win, Philadelphia reached the Super Bowl for the first time since Super Bowl LII. The win would also mark the franchise's fourth overall NFC Championship and their third since 2004, all of which were won at Lincoln Financial Field.

Super Bowl LVII: vs. (A1) Kansas City Chiefs The Eagles fell 38\u201335 to the Kansas City Chiefs in the franchise's fourth ever Super Bowl appearance. Pre-game storylines centered on Eagles center Jason Kelce and Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce becoming the first brothers to meet in the Super Bowl. Additionally, Chiefs head coach Andy Reid was facing his former team, where he spent 14 seasons as head coach (1999-2012). Finally, the game featured two of the league's best quarterbacks in Jalen Hurts and Patrick Mahomes in the first-ever Super Bowl matchup of two black quarterbacks. Hurts opened the scoring with a quarterback sneak into the end zone on the first series. Mahomes needed six plays to match, tying the game on a touchdown pass to Kelce. On the first play of the second quarter, Hurts connected on a 45-yard bomb to receiver A. J. Brown in the end zone to make it 14\u20137 Eagles. On Philadelphia's next possession, Hurts drove to midfield, but lost the football in the backfield on a third down play. Chiefs linebacker Nick Bolton recovered the fumble and returned it for a game-tying touchdown. Hurts responded to the costly miscue with a 75-yard drive ending in him rushing the ball in himself for a 4-yard score. On Kansas City's next possession, Mahomes appeared to aggravate an ankle injury he had suffered earlier in the playoffs after a tackle by linebacker T. J. Edwards. A 22-yard reception by A.J. Brown helped set up a 35-yard Jake Elliott field goal, sending the teams to halftime with the score 24\u201314 Philadelphia. The Chiefs offense would play"

Their opening drive of the third quarter culminated in an Isiah Pacheco 1-yard touchdown run, narrowing the score to 27\u201324. Hurts countered with a 17-play drive that included two impressive third down conversions to tight end Dallas Goedert, but the drive ended in a field goal, allowing Kansas City to take its first lead when Mahomes hit Kadarius Toney for a 5-yard touchdown on the Chiefs' next possession. The Eagles then went three-and-out, and the resultant Arryn Siposs punt was kicked away from the planned coverage, enabling a 65-yard return by Toney to the Philadelphia 5-yard line. Mahomes, on a broken play, completed a touchdown pass to Skyy Moore, opening up a 35\u201327 Chiefs lead. With just over nine minutes remaining in regulation, Hurts drove the Eagles to midfield then connected on a 45-yard pass down the left sideline to DeVonta Smith. Hurts scored on a quarterback sneak on the next play, then broke a tackle on the two-point conversion attempt to tie the game at 35\u201335. Philadelphia's defense remained unable to stop the Chiefs, however, and Mahomes drove into the red zone.

The Eagles entered the season as defending NFC champions. This season would mark the first season since 2010 that the Eagles wore Kelly green uniforms and the first time since 1995 that they would be featured multiple times in a season. Despite starting with a 10\u20131 record for the second consecutive season, the Eagles lost five of their last six games. In Week 17, after a devastating home loss to the Arizona Cardinals, the Eagles lost control of their own destiny for the NFC East division title. In Week 18, after the Cowboys' victory against the Commanders and their own loss to the Giants, the Eagles were locked into the #5 seed. Even in victory, the Eagles had problems with a poor defense the entire season, which was ranked 26th out of 32; 8 of their 11 victories fell within one score, while they conversely suffered blowout losses to the playoff-bound 49ers and Cowboys, as well as the Giants by 3 scores. In fact, the Eagles defense allowed the third-most points of any team in the league, with over 428. The Eagles' late season woes continued into the playoffs, in which they were eliminated in the Wild Card round by the NFC South champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers in a 32\u20139 loss. This was the final season for center Jason Kelce, who announced his retirement in the subsequent offseason after spending his entire 13-year career with the Eagles.

New England would rally back with a pair of touchdown passes from Mac Jones to Hunter Henry and Kendrick Bourne. In the second half, Jake Elliott would kick 3 field goals from 56, 48, and 51 yards. The Patriots would march down the field late in the 4th quarter and score a touchdown pass from Jones to Bourne again making the score 25\u201320. A Jalen Hurts fumble and turnover on downs gave the Patriots 2 more shots for the go-ahead touchdown. On 4th-and-11 with 24 seconds left in the game, Jones appeared to complete a pass to Kayshon Boutte to set up 1st-and-goal for the Patriots at the Eagle's 7-yard line before Boutte was forced out of bounds by Josh Jobe. However, the pass was ruled incomplete after the replay showed that Boutte did not get both feet inbounds after catching the ball, therefore resulting in a turnover on downs, and the Eagles would win their season opener for the third straight year (all"

Week 2: vs. Minnesota Vikings The Eagles would strike first on a 24-yard Jake Elliott field goal. In the second quarter, the Vikings would get on the board with a 5-yard touchdown pass from Kirk Cousins to T.J. Hockenson. The Eagles would punch back with a Jalen Hurts \"tush push\" 1-yard touchdown. The Vikings would march down the field with Cousins hitting a wide open Justin Jefferson. On the play, Jefferson was diving towards the pylon. However, in doing so, the ball would come loose from his hand prior to going over the plain and would go out of bounds in the endzone resulting in a touchback. Under a minute remaining, the Eagles would march down to set up Jake Elliott for a 61-yard field goal. It would tie as his longest career field goal made and put the Eagles up 13\u20137 at the half. On the opening second half drive, the Eagles would march down the field again and Jalen Hurts would score his second touchdown on the day with another \"tush push.\" The Eagles would once again get the ball back on a Vikings turnover and Jalen Hurts would hit DeVonta Smith for a 63-yard touchdown putting the Eagles up 27\u20137.

Keeping things interesting, the Vikings would quickly march down field and score a touchdown of their own from Cousins to Hockenson making the score 34\u201328. The Vikings would get the ball back one more time in a Hail Mary effort, but would fall short. The game was noted on the 4 Vikings turnovers caused by the Eagles defense and the Eagles vicious rushing attack mainly coming from Swift who had 175 yards on the ground. The Eagles would come out 2-0 for the second straight year. Week 3: at Tampa Bay Buccaneers The Eagles took a 13\u20133 lead at halftime and built up to a 25\u20133 lead during the 4th quarter. While the Buccaneers responded with a touchdown and a 2-point conversion, the Eagles never let Tampa Bay get the ball back. Week 4: vs. Washington Commanders In a back-and-forth thriller that featured many lead changes in the fourth quarter, the Eagles defeated their division rival in overtime. This win, along with a Miami Dolphins loss to the Buffalo Bills, allowed Philadelphia to become one of only two unbeaten teams remaining, the other being the San Francisco 49ers, who defeated the Arizona Cardinals later that day.

The Rams were shut out in the second half as the Eagles extended their lead with two fourth-quarter field goals to secure the win. Week 6: at New York Jets The Eagles entered their Week 6 matchup with the New York Jets as the lone remaining undefeated team in the league, thanks to the San Francisco 49ers' loss to the Cleveland Browns just moments after the kickoff. Philadelphia raced out to a 14\u20133 lead in the second quarter, but the game would quickly fall apart for the Eagles from there as the Jets continued to chip away at the lead over the remainder of the game. With their lead down to 14\u201312 at the two-minute warning, Jalen Hurts was picked off by Tony Adams, and gave the Jets an opportunity to win the game. Breece Hall scored the go-ahead touchdown for New York on the very next play, and Philadelphia failed to respond on their final drive, allowing the Jets to run the clock out. The Eagles fell to 5\u20131 on the season with the 20\u201314 upset loss. It also marked Philadelphia's first ever loss to the New York Jets in thirteen regular-season meetings.

Tyreek Hill would close the gap to seven points before halftime with a 27-yard touchdown reception. The teams traded punts to start the second half, before the Eagles forced a turnover on downs on a controversial play where James Bradberry appeared to grab the face mask of Cedrick Wilson Jr., but no penalty was called. A game-tying 22-yard pick six by Jerome Baker almost immediately after the controversial call seemed to turn the momentum in Miami's favor. However, Baker's pick six proved to be the last Dolphins score, as the Eagles took control of the ball for the rest of the game. On the very next possession, A. J. Brown scored on a 14-yard reception, and Kenneth Gainwell ran 3 yards for the game-clinching touchdown in the fourth quarter. With the 31\u201317 win, the Eagles improved to 6\u20131 on the season, and became the top team in the conference when the San Francisco 49ers lost to the Minnesota Vikings the following night.

The Eagles narrowly escaped with the victory when Dak Prescott completed a pass to CeeDee Lamb, who was tackled by Darius Slay four yards short of the end zone as time expired. Philadelphia improved to 8\u20131 for the second consecutive year with the win, and earned their first victory over a Dak Prescott led Cowboys team for the first time since 2019. Week 11: at Kansas City Chiefs In a rematch of Super Bowl LVII, the Chiefs took a 17\u20137 lead at halftime on touchdowns by Justin Watson and Travis Kelce and a field goal by Harrison Butker, while the only Eagles' scoring play of the first half was a touchdown by D'Andre Swift. However, the Eagles held the Chiefs scoreless in the second half and mounted a comeback. In the third quarter, Jalen Hurts rushed for a 10-yard touchdown to cut the Chiefs' lead to 17\u201314.

Week 12: vs. Buffalo Bills Despite trailing 24\u201314 at the end of the 3rd quarter, the Eagles were able to take the lead following a touchdown, an interception by the Bills and another touchdown. While the Bills took the lead just after the two minute warning with another touchdown, Jake Elliott converted a 59-yard field goal with 20 seconds left to force overtime. After the Eagles held the Bills to a field goal, Jalen Hurts rushed for a touchdown to complete the comeback.

While Philadelphia did respond in the second half with a fumble recovery touchdown by Jalen Carter, the Eagles could not score again, while Aubrey converted 3 more field goals.

However, the Giants started to chip away at the Eagles' lead during the third quarter. During the kickoff at the beginning of the half, Giants linebacker Isaiah Simmons threw Eagles wide receiver Olamide Zaccheaus into running back Boston Scott, causing a fumble that was recovered by Simmons. Soon after, Saquon Barkley scored on a 7-yard run, and near the end of the third quarter, Hurts threw an interception to cornerback Adoree' Jackson, who returned it 76 yards for a touchdown, during which Hurts was flagged for a horse-collar tackle while trying to chase down Jackson. The Giants elected to enforce that penalty on a two-point conversion attempt, which Barkley scored, cutting the Eagles' lead to 20\u201318.

With 32 seconds left to play, Jalen Hurts attempted a last-ditch effort to score only to be intercepted by Joey Blount, mirroring Philadelphia's defeat to the Seattle Seahawks two weeks prior, thus sealing the upset for Arizona. With the stunning 35\u201331 loss and the Dallas Cowboys' win over the Detroit Lions the night prior, the Eagles surrendered control of the NFC East and their playoff positioning to Dallas.

Standings Division Conference Postseason Schedule Game summaries NFC Wild Card Playoffs: at (4) Tampa Bay Buccaneers Philadelphia returned to the playoffs coming off a disastrous late-season collapse that saw them fall into the fifth seed, and were hoping to reverse their momentum with a win over NFC South champion Tampa Bay. Wide receiver A. J. Brown, who suffered a knee injury in the regular season finale against the New York Giants, was unable to make it to the game. Philadelphia's poor defense struggled to tackle Tampa Bay's ball carriers, giving up huge runs down the field; Tampa Bay logged 119 rushing yards on 29 carries and made 6-of-14 third down conversions, with Baker Mayfield throwing for 337 yards and three touchdowns. Most notably, cornerback James Bradberry made contact with Trey Palmer but failed to bring him down, proving costly as it facilitated his 56-yard touchdown run in the third quarter. Philadelphia's offensive line failed to perform well as Tampa Bay also employed the blitz defense against Jalen Hurts, leading to him getting sacked three times, with one of them occurring inside of Philadelphia's own end zone, resulting in a safety.

In the offseason, two longtime Eagles players, center Jason Kelce and defensive tackle Fletcher Cox, announced their retirements. This season was highlighted by the spectacular play of the newly acquired Saquon Barkley, who became the ninth running back in NFL history to reach 2,000 yards. Despite a turnover-plagued 2\u20132 start which included a stunning home loss to the Atlanta Falcons and a 33\u201316 drubbing at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the Eagles rebounded to win 16 of their final 17 games. With their Week 14 win over the Carolina Panthers, along with losses by the Falcons and Arizona Cardinals that same day, the Eagles clinched a playoff berth for the fourth straight year and seventh time in the last 8 seasons.

This loss also broke their 10-game winning streak.

The Eagles defense held Dallas to one touchdown while also forcing four turnovers: a C. J. Gardner-Johnson pick-six, an Oren Burks fumble, another Gardner-Johnson interception, and a Nolan Smith fumble. After several small fights throughout the early parts of the game, a massive fight broke out during the fourth quarter, resulting in the ejections of Cowboys players Jalen Brooks and Troy Pride as well as Eagles Safety Sydney Brown. With the win, the Eagles swept the Cowboys for the first time since 2011 and clinched the NFC East. Saquon Barkley reached 2,000 rushing yards, becoming the ninth running back in NFL history to do so. With the Vikings\u2019 victory later in the day, the Eagles were locked into the NFC's #2 seed. Week 18: vs. New York Giants On December 31, 2024, the Eagles revealed they would wear their blackout alternate uniforms for their home contest against their divisional rival, the New York Giants. The Eagles rested a majority of their starters as it was no longer mathematically possible to improve their seeding. They went on to win by a final score of 20\u201313, which gave them their second 14-win season in the last three years.

Philadelphia and Green Bay had previously played each other in Week 1, a 34\u201329 Eagles victory in Brazil. The Packers had finished the 2024 regular season with an 11\u20136 record, the best ever by an NFC #7 seed. Eagles starting quarterback Jalen Hurts was cleared from concussion protocol after having missed most of Week 16 and all of Week 17-18, returning to start the playoff run while also continuing to nurse a broken finger on his non-throwing hand, while Packers quarterback Jordan Love was looking to repeat his success from the 2023-24 NFL playoffs. A hit by Oren Burks on the opening kickoff dislodged the football and led to a Philadelphia recovery at Green Bay 28-yard line. Hurts found Jahan Dotson for a touchdown reception three plays later to open the scoring. Later in the quarter, the Eagles added a Jake Elliott field goal to complete an 11-play drive and extend the lead to 10\u20130. Interceptions by Darius Slay and Zack Baun helped hold Green Bay scoreless through the second quarter. The Packers cut the lead to 10\u20133 with a field goal in the third quarter, but the Eagles quickly responded with a 5-play drive featuring a 28-yard reception by DeVonta Smith and a 24-yard touchdown reception by tight end Dallas Goedert, in which he stiff-armed Packer corner Carrington Valentine multiple times on his way"

Green Bay went for it fourth down on their next possession, but Malik Heath could not bring in Love's pass and keep his feet inbounds. An unnecessary roughness penalty on Packers' defensive lineman T.J. Slaton for a late-hit on Saquon Barkley extended Philadelphia's next drive and led to a 32-yard Elliott field goal and a 22\u201310 lead. Quinyon Mitchell then intercepted Love in the end zone to put to rest any Green Bay comeback hopes.

This was the Eagles' first Wild Card victory at home since 2006. NFC Divisional Playoffs: vs. (4) Los Angeles Rams The Eagles defeated the Los Angeles Rams 28\u201322 in a contest heavily impacted by winter weather in the second half. In Week 12, Philadelphia had defeated the Rams 37\u201320 at SoFi Stadium as Saquon Barkley set the Eagles franchise record for rushing yards in a single game with 255.

Philadelphia scored on the opening drive on a 44-yard touchdown run by Jalen Hurts, but Jake Elliott missed the extra point leaving the Eagles with a 6\u20130 lead. The Rams answered with a 13-play touchdown drive, capped by a 4-yard Tyler Higbee touchdown reception, to take a 7\u20136 lead. Later in the opening quarter, Saquon Barkley broke a 62-yard touchdown run to the right side to give the Eagles a 13\u20137 lead. Los Angeles responded with a field goal to cut the Eagles lead to 13\u201310, and timely sacks by Verse prevented Philadelphia from scoring on either of its second quarter possessions.

A false start penalty took a would-be Hurts touchdown off the board, forcing the Eagles to settle for a field goal and a 19\u201315 lead. On Los Angeles' next drive, Matthew Stafford was strip sacked by Nolan Smith, with Zack Baun recovering at the Rams 38-yard line. The Eagles converted another field goal to extend the lead to 22\u201315. Following a three-and-out by the Rams, Barkley broke loose in the snow down the left sideline for a 78-yard touchdown with under five minutes to play, but another missed extra point kept the Eagles lead to 28\u201315. The Rams, in a hurry up offense, proceeded to score a touchdown to cut the Eagles lead to 28\u201322.

NFC Championship: vs. (6) Washington Commanders The Eagles exploded for 55 points in a dismantling of their division rival Washington Commanders. The game marked the second ever playoff meeting between the Commanders and Eagles; their first came in the 1990 NFC Wild Card Game, where the then-Washington Redskins defeated the Eagles 20\u20136 at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia. This was the first time the NFC Championship featured a divisional matchup since the Los Angeles Rams and San Francisco 49ers from the NFC West met in the 2021\u201322 playoffs, and the first involving NFC East sides since the New York Giants played the Redskins in 1986\u201387. During the 2024 regular season, the Eagles and Commanders split the series, with the Eagles winning 26\u201318 during Week 11 in Philadelphia, and the Commanders winning 36\u201333 during Week 16 in Washington. The Commanders were coming off a 45\u201331 upset of the top-seeded Detroit Lions, and Jayden Daniels was looking to become the first rookie quarterback to lead his team to the Super Bowl. Daniels converted two fourth downs on the opening 18-play drive. However, the Commanders settled for a field goal. On the Eagles' first offensive play, Saquon Barkley broke a 60-yard touchdown run to make it 7\u20133. Linebacker Zack Baun forced a fumble on Washington's next drive, recovered by safety Reed Blankenship."

In the second quarter, Washington narrowed their deficit to 14\u201312 with a field goal (capping off a drive extended by a successful fake punt), followed by a 36-yard Terry McLaurin touchdown reception after a missed 54-yard field goal attempt by Eagles kicker Jake Elliott gave the Commanders a short field. Facing a 4th-and-5 from the Washington 45-yard line on the Eagles' ensuing drive, Jalen Hurts connected on a 31-yard pass to A. J. Brown. This crucial conversation led to points on a 1-yard \"tush push\" touchdown by Hurts. With less than two minutes left in the half, the Commanders fumbled the kickoff return, giving the Eagles the ball back. Hurts would complete a 4-yard touchdown pass to Brown to extend the lead to 27\u201312. Washington added another field goal to make the halftime score 27\u201315.

The Eagles were forced to punt on their opening drive after a 32-yard completion to A. J. Brown was nullified by an offensive pass interference penalty. JuJu Smith-Schuster gained 11 yards on Kansas City's first offensive play, but it was to be the Chiefs' only first down until the third quarter. Jalen Hurts completed a 28-yard pass to Jahan Dotson on the Eagles ensuing drive just short of the endzone, then \"tush pushed\" the ball in on the next play for a 7\u20130 lead. After another Chiefs punt, Hurts took the Eagles back into Kansas City territory, but the drive ended on an interception to Bryan Cook \u2013 his first since Week 10, over half the entire NFL season ago.

On December 6, 2020, Hurts relieved Carson Wentz, who was benched due to ineffective play, against the Green Bay Packers.

During a Week 12 loss to the New York Giants, Hurts suffered an ankle injury which kept him out for the following week's game against the New York Jets. The Eagles won that game 33\u201318 led by backup quarterback Gardner Minshew. Hurts returned after the bye week in a Week 15 matchup against Washington en route to a 27\u201317 victory.

Since his hiring as head coach for the Eagles, Sirianni has led the team to the playoffs in each of his first four seasons as head coach, including winning two division titles, two conference championships, and a victory in Super Bowl LIX in 2025. Early life and education Sirianni was born on June 15, 1981, in Jamestown, New York, the son of Fran and Amy Sirianni.

Kansas City Chiefs In 2009, Sirianni was hired as offensive quality control coach for the Kansas City Chiefs by Todd Haley, the new head coach of the Chiefs. Sirianni and Haley got to know each other when they attended the same YMCA when Sirianni was in college and Haley was wide receivers coach for the Chicago Bears. Sirianni was retained under new coach Romeo Crennel and was promoted to wide receivers coach in Crennel's only season as the Chiefs head coach. Sirianni was not retained for the 2013 season under new head coach Andy Reid. San Diego Chargers Sirianni joined the San Diego Chargers when Mike McCoy was hired as the team's head coach in 2013. In 2014 he became the team's quarterbacks coach, working with quarterback Philip Rivers and offensive coordinator Frank Reich. In 2016, Sirianni became the wide receivers coach.

The Eagles were ultimately eliminated by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the Wild Card Round of the 2023 NFL Playoffs. Sirianni was widely blamed for both the offensive and defensive regression of the Eagles in 2023. In particular, Sirianni caused a significant controversy when he removed defensive coordinator Sean Desai from defensive play calling and passed them onto former New England Patriots defensive coordinator and Detroit Lions head coach Matt Patricia, a move that ultimately backfired and led the Eagles to finish second to last in total defense. Sirianni ultimately fired Desai, Patricia, and offensive coordinator Brian Johnson after the 2023 season ended. 2024 season: Super Bowl LIX victory During Week 2 of the 2024 season against the Atlanta Falcons Sirianni was widely criticized for throwing the ball on 3rd and 3 at the Atlanta 10-yard line up 18\u201315, where the pass fell incomplete, giving Atlanta time to march down the field and secure the victory.

Despite early struggles and a 2\u20132 start, Sirianni coached the Eagles to a 14\u20133 regular season record and an NFC East title, finishing as the No. 2 seed in the conference.

    "text": "The Philadelphia Eagles are a professional American football team based in Philadelphia. The Eagles compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the National Football Conference (NFC) East division. The team plays its home games at Lincoln Financial Field in the South Philadelphia Sports Complex. The franchise was established in 1933 as a replacement for the bankrupt Frankford Yellow Jackets when a group led by Bert Bell secured the rights to an NFL franchise in Philadelphia. Since their formation, the Eagles have appeared in the playoffs 31 times, won 16 division titles (including 13 in the NFC East), appeared in four pre-merger NFL Championship Games, winning three of them (1948, 1949, and 1960), and appeared in five Super Bowls, winning Super Bowls LII and LIX. The Philadelphia Eagles rank among the best teams in the NFL for attendance and have sold out every home game continuously since the 1999 season. The Eagles are owned by Jeffrey Lurie, who bought the team in 1994 for $185 million. In December 2024, the Eagles became one of the first teams in the NFL to sell an ownership stake to outside investors. The deal sold 8% of the franchise at a valuation of $8.3 billion. History NFL in Philadelphia (1899\u20131931) The Frankford Athletic Association was organized in May 1899 in the parlor of the Suburban Club. The cost of purchasing a share in the association was $10. However, there also were contributing memberships, ranging from $1 to $2.50, made available to the general public. The Association was a community-based non-profit organization of local residents and businesses.

In keeping with its charter, which stated that \"all profits shall be donated to charity\", all of the team's excess income was donated to local charitable institutions. The original Frankford Athletic Association apparently disbanded prior to the 1909 football season. Several of the original players from the 1899 football team kept the team together, and they became known as Loyola Athletic Club. In keeping with Yellow Jackets tradition, they carried the \"Frankford\" name again in 1912, to become the Frankford Athletic Association. In the early 1920s, the Frankford Athletic Association's Yellow Jackets gained a reputation as being one of the best independent football teams in the nation. In 1922, Frankford absorbed the Philadelphia City Champion team, the Union Quakers of Philadelphia. That year, Frankford captured the unofficial championship of Philadelphia. During the 1922 and 1923 seasons, the Yellow Jackets compiled a 6\u20132\u20131 record against teams from the National Football League. This led to the Association being granted an NFL franchise in 1924, thus becoming the Frankford Yellow Jackets. In spite of winning the NFL championship in 1926, midway through the 1931 season, the Yellow Jackets went bankrupt and were forced to cease operations. Bell and Wray era (1933\u20131940) After more than a year of searching for a suitable replacement for the Yellow Jackets in the lucrative Philadelphia market, the National Football League granted an expansion franchise to an ownership group headed by Bert Bell and Lud Wray, who were also awarded the liquidated assets of the defunct Yellow Jackets organization. The Bell\u2013Wray group had to pay an entry fee of $3,500, or roughly US$67,000 in inflation-adjusted 2022 dollars and assumed a total debt of $11,000 the Yellow Jackets owed to three other NFL franchises.

Drawing inspiration from the Blue Eagle logo of the National Recovery Administration, a centerpiece of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal policies, Bell and Wray named their new franchise the Philadelphia Eagles. While it could seem as if the Yellow Jackets simply rebranded as the Eagles, both the Eagles organization and the NFL officially regard the teams as two separate entities. Not only was there no Philadelphia NFL team for a season and a half, but almost no players from the 1931 Yellow Jackets appeared on the Eagles' first roster. In the 1933 NFL season, the Eagles were one of three teams, along with the Pittsburgh Pirates (now the Pittsburgh Steelers) and the now-defunct Cincinnati Reds, to join the NFL as expansion teams. Wray became the Eagles' first head coach after being persuaded to assume the position by Bell, his former teammate at Penn. The Eagles originally intended to play their home games at Shibe Park, which was the home of the Philadelphia Athletics professional baseball in Philadelphia. When negotiations for the use of Shibe Park fell through, however, the Eagles struck a deal with the Athletics' crosstown rival, the Philadelphia Phillies, to begin playing at the Baker Bowl. The Eagles played their first game on October 15, 1933, against the New York Giants at the Polo Grounds in New York City, and lost the game 56\u20130.

The Eagles struggled over the course of their first decade, never winning more than four games in any of their first ten seasons. Their best finish was in 1934, the second season for the Eagles, when they tied for third in the East. The Eagles' early rosters largely consisted of former Penn, Temple, and Villanova players who played for the Eagles for a few years before going on to other things. In 1935, Bell proposed an annual college draft to equalize talent across the league. The draft was a revolutionary concept in professional sports. Having teams select players in inverse order of their finish in the standings, a practice still followed today, strove to increase fan interest by guaranteeing that even the worst teams would have the opportunity for annual infusions of the best college talent. Between 1927, when the NFL changed from a sprawling Midwestern-based association to a narrower, major-market league, and 1934, three teams, the Chicago Bears, New York Giants, and Green Bay Packers, won all but one title with the exception of the Providence Steam Roller, which won in 1928. By 1936, the Eagles suffered significant financial losses and were sold through a public auction. Bert Bell was the only bidder and became the sole owner of the team. Wray refused a reduction in his salary and left the team. Bell assumed the head coaching position and led the team to a record of 1\u201311, last place in the league.

In 1940, Bell balked at a 66% rent increase plus 10% of the gate receipts proposed by the City of Philadelphia for the use of Municipal Stadium and signed a lease for Shibe Park, which was renamed Connie Mack Stadium in 1954. At Connie Mack Stadium, the Eagles were also able to play night games, since lights were installed at the stadium the year before. In the 1941 season, the Eagles played their home opener at Municipal Stadium, and then moved to Shibe Park. To accommodate football at Shibe Park during the winter, management erected stands in right field, parallel to 20th Street. Some 20 feet high, these east stands included 22 rows of seats. The goalposts stood along the first base line and in left field. The uncovered east stands enlarged the park's capacity to over 39,000, but the Eagles rarely drew more than 25,000 to 30,000. The Eagles finished the 1937 season 2\u20138\u20131 and continued to struggle over the next three seasons. Thompson, Wolman and the Happy Hundred era (1941\u20131969) In December 1940, Bell intervened to stop the sale of Art Rooney's Steelers to Alexis Thompson, and Rooney then acquired half of Bell's interest in the Eagles. In a series of events known as the Pennsylvania Polka, Rooney and Bell exchanged their entire Eagles roster and their territorial rights in Philadelphia to Thompson for his entire Steelers roster and his rights in Pittsburgh.

During the first years under Neale, the Eagles' struggles continued, and they finished the 1941 season with a 2\u20138\u20131 record. In the 1942 season, there was no improvement as the team finished the season 2\u20139. Steagles (1943) In 1943, with player shortages stemming from the U.S. entry engagement in World War II, it became difficult to fill the roster, and the team merged with the Steelers to form the \"Phil-Pitt Combine\", known as the Steagles. Greasy Neale continued to coach the team along with Steelers head coach Walt Kiesling. The team finished the 1943 season with a 5\u20134\u20131 record, and the merger, which was never intended to be a permanent arrangement, was dissolved at the season's end. In 1944, the Eagles, led by head coach Greasy Neale and running back Steve Van Buren, had their first winning season in team history.

With home-field advantage and a blinding snowstorm on their side, the Eagles won their first NFL Championship against the Chicago Cardinals by a score of 7\u20130. The only score came in the fourth quarter when Steve Van Buren ran for a five-yard touchdown. Because of the severe weather, few fans witnessed the joyous occasion. Prior to the start of the 1949 season, the Eagles were sold by Thompson to a syndicate of 100 buyers, known as the \"Happy Hundred\", each of whom paid $3,000 for a share of the team. While the leader of the \"Happy Hundred\" was noted Philadelphia businessman James P. Clark, one unsung investor was Leonard Tose. NFL champions (1949) In 1949, the Eagles returned to the NFL Championship game for a third consecutive year. The Eagles were favored by a touchdown, and won 14\u20130 for their second consecutive title game shutout. Running back Steve Van Buren rushed for 196 yards on 31 carries for the Eagles, and their defense held the Rams to just 21 yards on the ground. Chuck Bednarik was selected as the first overall pick in the 1949 NFL draft. An All-American lineman/linebacker from the University of Pennsylvania, Bednarik would go on to become one of the greatest and most beloved players in Eagles history. In 1950, the Eagles opened the season against the AAFC champion Cleveland Browns, who, along with two other AAFC franchises, had just joined the NFL. The Eagles were expected to make short work of the Browns, who were widely considered the dominant team in a lesser league.

However, the Browns lit up the Eagles' vaunted defense for 487 total yards, including 246 passing yards, in a 35\u201310 rout. The Eagles never recovered from the loss and finished the 1950 season 6\u20136. Following the 1950 season, Greasy Neale retired and was replaced by Bo McMillin. Two games into the 1951 season, McMillin was forced to retire following a diagnosis of terminal stomach cancer. Wayne Millner finished out the season before being replaced by Jim Trimble. While the remnants of the great 1940s teams managed to stay competitive for the first few years of the decade, and younger players like Bobby Walston and Sonny Jurgensen occasionally provided infusions of talent, the team lacked the total talent necessary for true greatness during most of the 1950s. After the 1957 season, the Eagles moved from Connie Mack Stadium to Franklin Field at the University of Pennsylvania. Franklin Field had a vastly expanded seating capacity for the Eagles. While Connie Mack Stadium had a capacity of 39,000, Franklin Field's capacity was 60,000. In 1969, the grass field at Franklin Field was replaced by AstroTurf, making Franklin Field the first NFL stadium to use artificial turf. Buck Shaw years (1958\u20131960) In 1958, the Eagles took several steps to improve, hiring Buck Shaw as head coach and acquiring quarterback Norm Van Brocklin in a trade with the Los Angeles Rams.

Former Eagles owner and co-founder Bert Bell had become NFL commissioner, and attended the Eagles game on October 11 at Franklin Field against the Pittsburgh Steelers, a team Bell used to own. Bell refused the box seats that the Eagles reserved for him and purchased his own tickets to sit with the fans. During the fourth quarter, while sitting behind the end zone, Bell suffered a heart attack and died later that day. NFL champions (1960) The Eagles' 1960 season remains one of the most celebrated years in team history. Shaw, Van Brocklin, and Bednarik, each in their last season before retirement, led an Eagles team more notable for its grit than its talent. One observer later quipped that the team had \"nothing but a championship\" to its first division title since 1949. The team was aided by their two Pro Bowl receivers, wide receiver Tommy McDonald, who later wrote an autobiography titled They Pay Me to Catch Footballs, and tight end Pete Retzlaff. On November 20, 1960, at Yankee Stadium in The Bronx, Bednarik launched a tackle against New York Giants' running back Frank Gifford, which has come to be known as The Hit, a tackle that is routinely ranked as one of the hardest and most vicious hits in NFL history. With the game tied 10 to 10 in the fourth quarter, Gifford caught a short pass over the middle and was immediately hit by Bednarik with a clothesline tackle so hard that it dropped Gifford to the ground unconscious.

Gifford was removed from the field on a stretcher and transported to a local hospital by ambulance, where he remained for ten days. Gifford was diagnosed with a deep concussion that resulted in his retirement from the game for 18 months. On the 100th anniversary of the NFL's founding, the NFL ranked Bednarik's tackle the 44th greatest play in league history. On December 26, 1960, one of the coldest days in recorded Philadelphia history, the Eagles faced Vince Lombardi's Green Bay Packers in the 1960 NFL Championship Game and dealt the formidable Lombardi the sole championship game loss of his storied career. Bednarik lined up at center on offense and at linebacker on defense. Fittingly, the game ended as Bednarik tackled a struggling Jim Taylor and refused to allow him to stand until the last seconds had ticked away. Van Brocklin came to Philadelphia and agreed to play through 1960 with an understanding that, upon his retirement as a player, he would succeed Shaw as head coach. Ownership, however, opted to promote assistant coach Nick Skorich instead, and Van Brocklin quit the organization in a fit of pique, instead becoming head coach of the expansion Minnesota Vikings. Back-up quarterback Sonny Jurgensen became the Eagles' starter for the 1961 season; they finished a half-game behind the New York Giants for first place in the Eastern Conference standings with a 10\u20134 record. Despite the on-the-field success, however, the franchise was in turmoil. The 1962 team, decimated by injury, managed only three wins and were embarrassed at home in a 49\u20130 loss to the Packers.

The 1962 team, decimated by injury, managed only three wins and were embarrassed at home in a 49\u20130 loss to the Packers. The off-field chaos continued through 1963, as the 65 shareholders remaining from the original Happy Hundred sold the team to Jerry Wolman, a 36-year-old millionaire Washington developer who outbid local bidders for the team, paying an unprecedented $5.505 million for control of the club. In 1964, Wolman hired former Cardinals and Washington Redskins coach Joe Kuharich to a 15-year contract. Over the next five seasons, the team failed to make the playoffs and the failures of the team over this period were highlighted by the Santa Claus incident, when fans pelted a Santa Claus with snowballs during a halftime Christmas pageant. The team had only one winning season, in 1966, finishing second in the NFL Eastern Conference. The Eagles lost to the Baltimore Colts 20\u201314, in the post-season's third place consolation game, the Playoff Bowl, which was held at the Orange Bowl in Miami. The Eagles finished 6\u20137\u20131 in 1967. In the following season, the Eagles fell even further in the standings, recording a 2\u201312 record in 1968.

With the merger of the NFL and AFL in 1970, the Eagles were placed in the NFC East Division with the New York Giants, Washington Redskins, and Dallas Cowboys. The Eagles' heated rivalry with the Giants is the oldest of the NFC East rivalries, dating back to 1933, and is often cited as one of the best rivalries in the NFL. 1970 was also the last season for the Eagles at Franklin Field; the team finished the first post-merger season in last place in their division at 3\u201310\u20131. In 1971, the Eagles moved to Veterans Stadium, which had just been constructed and was initially acclaimed as a triumph of ultra-modern sports engineering. After a 3\u201310\u20131 record in 1970 and three consecutive blowout losses to Cincinnati, Dallas, and San Francisco to open the 1971 season, Williams was fired and replaced by assistant coach Ed Khayat, a defensive lineman on the Eagles' 1960 NFL championship team. Williams and Khayat were hampered by Retzlaff's decision to trade longtime starting quarterback Norm Snead to the Minnesota Vikings in early 1971, leaving the Eagles a choice between journeyman Pete Liske and raw Rick Arrington. Khayat lost his first two games but won six of the season's last nine, thanks largely to the efforts of the Eagles' defense, led by all-pro safety Bill Bradley, who led the NFL in interceptions (11) and interception return yardage (248).

Philadelphia beat the Kansas City Chiefs (which had had the best record in the AFC a year before) 21\u201320 and the Houston Oilers 18\u201317 on six field goals by kicker Tom Dempsey. The latter game had been called the \"Johnny Rodgers Bowl\", because the loser, in finishing last in the league, would gain the first overall pick in the 1973 NFL draft, which was then presumed to be Nebraska wingback Johnny Rodgers, the Heisman Trophy winner. With their loss, the Oilers got first pick and took University of Tampa defensive end John Matuszak, who later faced Philadelphia in Super Bowl XV. With the second overall pick, the Eagles selected USC tight end Charle Young. Khayat was replaced by offensive guru Mike McCormack for the 1973 season. Aided by the skills of quarterback Roman Gabriel and towering young wide receiver Harold Carmichael, they managed to infuse a bit of vitality into a previously moribund offense. New general manager Jim Murray also began to add talent on the defensive side of the line, most notably through the addition of future Pro Bowl linebacker Bill Bergey in 1974. Overall, however, the team was still mired in mediocrity. McCormack was fired after a 4\u201310 1975 season.

Despite the team's young talent and Gabriel's occasional flashes of brilliance, the Eagles finished 1976 with the same 4\u201310 record as in 1975. In 1977, the first seeds of hope began to emerge. The team obtained hard-throwing quarterback Ron Jaworski in a trade from the Los Angeles Rams in exchange for popular tight end Charle Young. The defense, led by Bergey and defensive coordinator Marion Campbell, began earning a reputation as one of the hardest-hitting in the league. 1978 saw one of the great moments in Eagles history, The Miracle at the Meadowlands, when Herman Edwards returned a fumble by Giants' quarterback Joe Pisarcik for a touchdown with 20 seconds left in the game, resulting in a 19\u201317 Eagles victory. The Eagles would edge into the playoffs with a 9\u20137 season. Young running back Wilbert Montgomery became the first Eagle since Steve Van Buren to exceed 1,000 yards in a season.

The Eagles traveled to New Orleans for Super Bowl XV, where they were heavily favored over the Oakland Raiders, who had squeaked into the playoffs as a wild-card team. Things did not go the Eagles' way, beginning with Tose's imprudent decision to bring comedian Don Rickles into the pregame locker room to lighten the mood. Jaworski's first pass was intercepted by Rod Martin, setting up an Oakland touchdown. Later in the first quarter, a potential game-tying 40-yard touchdown pass to Rodney Parker was nullified by an illegal-motion penalty. The final score was 27\u201310. Journeyman quarterback Jim Plunkett was named the game's MVP. The team got off to a promising start in the 1981 season by winning their first six games. They ended up 10\u20136 to earn a wild-card berth. However, their hopes to repeat as NFC champs were dashed in the wild-card round by the New York Giants, who won 27\u201321. After the Eagles finished 3\u20136 in the strike-shortened 1982 season, Vermeil quit the team, citing \"burnout\". Defensive coordinator Marion Campbell replaced Vermeil as head coach. Campbell had helped to popularize the \"bend-don't-break\" defensive strategy in the 1970s. Philadelphia struggled through the mid-1980s, marked by flagging fan participation.

The team again struggled during the 1985 season, and Campbell was fired after week 16, to be replaced by assistant head coach/defensive backs coach Fred Bruney for the season's last game. In the 1985 Supplemental draft, the Eagles acquired the rights to the Memphis Showboats' elite pass rusher Reggie White. Buddy Ryan years (1986\u20131990) In 1986, the arrival of head coach Buddy Ryan and his fiery attitude sparked team performance and ignited the fan base. Immediately infusing the team with his hard-as-nails attitude, the Eagles quickly became known for their tough defense and tougher attitudes. Ryan began rejuvenating the team by releasing several aging players, including Ron Jaworski. Randall Cunningham took his place and, despite a 5\u201310\u20131 season, began showing considerable promise. 1987 saw another strike, which shortened the season by one game. The substitutes who had filled in for the strikers performed poorly and were crushed 41\u201322 by the Dallas Cowboys. After the strike, the regular Eagles' 1987 team won a 37\u201320 revenge game against Dallas. The season record was 7\u20138, of which three games had been played by substitutes.

The game became known as the \"Fog Bowl\", due to the inclement weather during the game. The Eagles lost, 20\u201312. The following two years would see playoff appearances as well, but the team never made it past the first round. This failure was very frustrating to Eagles fans, as the team was widely regarded as among the most talented in the NFL. On offense, the Eagles were led by quarterback Cunningham, one of the most exciting players of his generation; tight end Keith Jackson; and running back Keith Byars. The defense is commonly acknowledged as among the greatest in league history, and as the best to never win a championship. The two 1989 matches with Dallas were known as the Bounty Bowls. Both were won easily by the Eagles (the Cowboys finished 1\u201315 that year), and were marked by Ryan insulting new Cowboys coach Jimmy Johnson by placing a bounty on their kicker, and by Eagles fans throwing snowballs at him at Veterans Stadium. On November 12, 1990, during a Monday Night Football game at the Vet, the Eagles defeated the Washington Redskins by a score of 28\u201314, as the defense scored three of the team's four touchdowns.

Running back Brian Mitchell, who would later be signed by the Eagles, was called upon to finish the game as the Redskins' quarterback. Washington returned to Philadelphia in the first round of the playoffs to defeat the Eagles 20\u20136, ending their season. Ryan was fired on January 7, 1991, and was replaced by offensive coordinator Rich Kotite. The team started the 1991 season with the loss of starting quarterback Randall Cunningham due to a knee injury. Backup quarterback Jim McMahon assumed the starting role for the rest of the season. Despite having the top-rated defense in the league, the team failed to make the playoffs by finishing third in the NFC East with a record of 10\u20136. On June 25, 1992, All Pro defensive tackle Jerome Brown was killed in an automobile accident. The team and fan base dedicated the 1992 season to \"bring it home for Jerome\". The team finished second in the NFC East with an 11\u20135 record to earn a wild-card playoff spot. Kotite led the Eagles to a victory over the New Orleans Saints in the wild-card game but then fell to the Dallas Cowboys in the Divisional round. Another blow to the team was the loss of all-time sacks leader Reggie White to free agency in the off-season.

In 1993, Kotite's Eagles fell apart after a promising start and miss the playoffs, ending the regular season 8\u20138. Jeffrey Lurie era (1994\u2013present) By 1994, team owner Norman Braman had become largely unpopular among local fans and a polarizing presence in the front office. Jeffrey Lurie bought the Eagles on May 6, 1994, for an estimated $185 million. In Lurie's first season as owner in 1994, the team went 7\u20139 and again missed the playoffs. Rich Kotite was fired and replaced by San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator Ray Rhodes, who successfully lured 49ers star Ricky Watters to join the team as a free agent. In 1995, Rhodes's first season, the Eagles got off to a slow start by losing three of their first four games but subsequently rebounded to finish with a 10\u20136 record and a playoff spot. In the Wild Card Round, the Eagles, playing at home, overwhelmed the Detroit Lions 58\u201337, with 31 of Philadelphia's points coming in the second quarter.

Rhodes benched Cunningham in favor of Rodney Peete, leading to friction between the two. Earlier, rumors had circulated that Lurie and Rhodes had tried to trade Cunningham to the Arizona Cardinals. However, no such trade materialized and Cunningham retired shortly after the season. In 1996, the Eagles' uniform colors were changed from the classic kelly green to a darker midnight green. The team got off to a good start, winning three of their first four games. However, a week 5 Monday night game at Veterans Stadium against the rival Cowboys witnessed a season-ending knee injury to Peete, loss of the team's momentum, and the transition to an offense led by Ty Detmer and Watters. While Detmer played well and Watters rushed for 1,411 yards, the season conformed to what had become a familiar pattern: 10\u20136 record and early elimination (a 14\u20130 shutout by the 49ers) in the playoffs. In the 1996 NFL draft, future fan-favorite and hall-of-famer Brian Dawkins was chosen in the second round. The continued early playoff exits led fans and local media to cast blame on high-priced free agents (Irving Fryar, Watters, Troy Vincent, and Guy McIntyre) for not stepping up in big games, especially in the postseason. Rhodes gradually deteriorated under the stress of the job, and players were beginning to grow tired of his brash demeanor and often autocratic coaching style.

Home attendance was declining, a quarterback controversy was deteriorating an already rudderless locker room, and the players had all but tuned out the embattled coaching staff. Left with little choice after a disastrous season, fan revolt, and sagging team morale, Lurie fired Rhodes and hired Green Bay Packers quarterback coach Andy Reid as head coach. Andy Reid years (1999\u20132012) The Eagles reemerged as a predominant NFL team under the leadership of new head coach Andy Reid, who was hired away from the Green Bay Packers, where he was the Packers' quarterback coach. Reid's first notable step was drafting Syracuse quarterback Donovan McNabb with the second overall pick in the 1999 NFL draft. The Eagles' awful 1998 season would have entitled the Eagles to first pick but it was awarded to the rebooted Cleveland Browns. Despite clearing the roster for new talent by releasing unpopular and aging veterans such as Ricky Watters and Irving Fryar, Reid was still a virtual unknown before his arrival as head coach, and his appointment was met initially with skepticism among Philadelphia fans. The drafting of McNabb was unpopular with many Eagles fans, many of whom traveled to Madison Square Garden for the 1999 Draft and booed the selection, believing the Eagles instead should have selected Ricky Williams, a University of Texas running back who had been named the 1998 AP College Player of the Year.

Another six home games in the 1999 season sold out only because several local small business owners bought the remaining unsold tickets to spare Philadelphia-area viewers a television blackout of the game. The Week 5 home game at Veterans Stadium on October 10, 1999, against the Dallas Cowboys represented the last play of Cowboys wide receiver Michael Irvin's career. In the game, Irvin was driven into the turf by Eagles safety Tim Hauck, which left Irvin lying motionless. Some Eagles fans responded with applause, giving further rise to Philadelphia's reputation as unduly aggressive and hostile fans. Irvin was transported from the field by stretcher and then by ambulance to Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. Irvin, who was diagnosed with a potentially threatening cervical spine injury and forced to announce his NFL retirement after the injury, later said the Philadelphia fans were applauding his departure rather than his serious injury. The team finished the season with a record of 5\u201311. The 2000 regular-season opener in Dallas on September 3 became known in NFL lore as the \"Pickle Juice Game\".

The nickname came about because an Eagles trainer had prepared for the predicted heat by having the players drink the juice from jars of dill pickles in order to retain body moisture and stave off cramps and heat exhaustion. The experiment proved successful as the Eagles won 41\u201314 while multiple Cowboys players had been consigned to the bench, unable to handle the torrid climate while the Eagles had no players benched. The game was also significant as marking the beginning of Philadelphia's domination of the NFC East. The team finished the season at 11\u20135, reaching the playoffs as a wild card, which restored fan optimism. After brushing aside the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 21\u20133, the Eagles moved to the second round of the playoffs, only to lose 20\u201310 to the New York Giants. After compiling an 11\u20135 record in 2001, the Eagles reached the playoffs again, this time at the top of their division. In a near rerun of the previous year, they disposed of the Buccaneers in a 31\u20139 game. In the second round, the Eagles defeated the Bears 33\u201319 at Soldier Field.

Once again, the team went 12\u20134 for the season and then reached the conference championship game. In doing so, the Eagles became the first team in modern history to get that far in the postseason after having been shut out at home in its first game. They achieved that distinction despite getting only five touchdown receptions all year by their wide receivers, which tied the league-low since the regular-season schedule was lengthened to its present 16 games in 1978 (this record would be broken in 2004 when the New York Giants' wide receivers caught only two touchdown passes). The Eagle receivers went through both September and October without a TD catch; the last time an NFL team had done that was in 1945. In the Divisional Round of the playoffs, the Eagles beat the Green Bay Packers 20\u201317 in overtime thanks in part to a late-game completion from McNabb to Freddie Mitchell on an iconic play that has come to be known as 4th and 26. They lost the NFC Championship game to the Carolina Panthers 14\u20133. Panthers cornerback Ricky Manning Jr. had three interceptions in the game.

Owens ended up with exactly 1,200 receiving yards and 14 touchdown receptions, although his season ended prematurely with an ankle injury in a December 19 game against the Dallas Cowboys. The Eagles' 12\u20137 victory in this game gave them home-field advantage throughout the conference playoffs for the third year in a row. The Eagles tied a record by clinching the NFC East division crown (their fourth straight) after only their eleventh game of the season, matching the mark set by the 1985 Chicago Bears and the 1997 San Francisco 49ers. Their final two regular-season games thus rendered meaningless, the Eagles sat out most of their first-string players in these games and lost both, yet still finished the season with a 13\u20133 record. McNabb had his best season to date, passing for 3,875 yards and 31 touchdowns, with only eight interceptions. This made him the first quarterback in NFL history to throw 30 or more TD passes and fewer than 10 interceptions in a single regular season. They then began their playoff run with the Divisional round at home against the sixth-seeded Minnesota Vikings. The Eagles led from the start and never looked back, as McNabb led a very efficient passing attack (21 of 33 for 286 yards and 2 TDs), Brian Westbrook dominated on the ground with 70 rushing yards, and Freddie Mitchell performed very well on the receiving corps (5 receptions for 65 yards and a TD), as Philadelphia won 27\u201314, setting up their fourth-straight NFC Championship appearance.

McNabb completed a 30-yard touchdown pass, and the Eagles defense held the Patriots to a 3 and out, but a crucial interception with 46 seconds left sealed their fate, as the Patriots won 24\u201321. The team took a step back in 2005 with a 6\u201310 record, failing to make the playoffs for the first time since the 1999 season. McNabb had played with a sports hernia and a broken thumb, starting 4\u20132 then losing three in a row, before he finally succumbed to injury and missed the rest of the season. For obnoxious behavior and a feud with McNabb, Owens was suspended after 7 games and was eventually cut. In 2006, the team lost McNabb 10 games in and went into turmoil.

In the closing seconds of the game, DeSean Jackson returned a punt 65 yards for a touchdown to win 38\u201331. This became known as the Miracle at the New Meadowlands. Vick led the Eagles to their sixth NFC East division title in ten seasons. With a record of 10\u20136, the Eagles clinched the third seed. In the wild card round, the Eagles lost 21\u201316 to the eventual Super Bowl XLV champion Green Bay Packers. The 2011 season for the Eagles was a major disappointment. The off-season was marred by a lockout that began in March after the NFL's collective bargaining agreement expired, making practices, trades, and free agency impossible. During the draft, the Eagles did comparatively little. After the lockout ended in July, the team embarked on a rash of high-profile FA signings, including Raiders CB Nnamdi Asomugha, Dolphins RB Ronnie Brown, Giants WR Steve Smith, Packers TE Donald Lee, Titans DE Jason Babin, and Packers DT Cullen Jenkins. Meanwhile, Kevin Kolb, displeased at losing the starting quarterback job to Michael Vick in 2010, was traded to Arizona for Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie.

Chip Kelly years (2013\u20132015) On January 16, 2013, after a 4\u201312 season, the Eagles brought in University of Oregon head coach Chip Kelly to succeed Reid as head coach.

Foles also tied Manning for most touchdown passes in a single game, with seven, against the Oakland Raiders, which also made him the youngest player in NFL history to throw for that many touchdowns in a game. Foles finished the regular season with 27 touchdown passes and only 2 interceptions, giving him the then-best TD-INT ratio in NFL history.

Foles finished the regular season with 27 touchdown passes and only 2 interceptions, giving him the then-best TD-INT ratio in NFL history. (That record was later broken by Tom Brady, in the 2016 season.) He also finished with a 119.0 passer rating, third-highest in league history behind only Aaron Rodgers in 2011 and Peyton Manning in 2004. He was also only the second quarterback in NFL history to have a game in which he topped 400 passing yards and a perfect passer rating. LeSean McCoy finished his Pro Bowl season as the league's top rusher with 1,607 rushing yards (also a franchise record) and 2,146 total yards from scrimmage, also best in the NFL. As a whole, the Eagles offense scored 51 touchdowns, most in franchise history, passing the previous season-high set back in 1948. Following the 2013 season, the Eagles released Pro-Bowl wide receiver DeSean Jackson due to his poor \"work ethic and attitude\", as well as speculation of his involvement in gang-related activities. The team signed All Pro safety Malcolm Jenkins to a three-year contract, worth $16.25 million. The Eagles opened the 2014 season winning their first three games and making NFL history as the only team ever to trail by ten or more points in their first three games and come back to win. Nick Foles struggled with turnovers, but ultimately did well and led the Eagles to a 6\u20132 record, before breaking his collarbone, resulting in his replacement by Mark Sanchez, who outplayed Foles.

After going 9\u20133 with a crucial win over the Dallas Cowboys, the Eagles lost their next three, and a week after losing the NFC East title, they lost an upset against the 3\u201311 Washington Redskins and were eliminated from playoff contention with the Cowboys' win over the Indianapolis Colts. Following the 2014 season, Chip Kelly was given total control and made some controversial personnel moves. He traded LeSean McCoy, who had become the team's all-time leading rusher after the 2014 season, for linebacker Kiko Alonso, a player Kelly coached at Oregon who had missed the entire 2014 season. He also cut ten-year veteran and starter Trent Cole, who was still a consistent threat on defense and was second only to legend Reggie White on the Eagles all-time sack list. He also traded the highly successful Nick Foles for Sam Bradford, who had missed the entire 2014 season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament. Kelly tried to re-sign Jeremy Maclin, who had stepped up as the team's leading wide receiver, but Maclin signed with the Kansas City Chiefs instead. However, the Eagles also acquired league leading rusher DeMarco Murray, which not only helped the Eagles, but hurt their rivals, the Dallas Cowboys. They also obtained Super Bowl champion Byron Maxwell, who left the Seattle Seahawks in free agency to sign a six-year, $63 million contract. The first two games of the 2015 season were dismal, as they lost both.

After Murray was injured, Ryan Mathews rushed for over 100 yards in a Week 3 win against the New York Jets. Kelly made Murray the unquestioned starter and although Murray's play improved over the season, he never regained his dominant form and was held to a career-low average of 3.6 yards per carry. On December 29, 2015, with one game left in the season, head coach Chip Kelly was released by the Eagles after a 6\u20139 record. Offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur was named interim head coach for the final game against the rival New York Giants, which Shurmur won 35\u201330. Doug Pederson years (2016\u20132020) The Eagles hired Kansas City Chiefs' offensive coordinator Doug Pederson as their next head coach on January 18, 2016. Pederson had been with the Chiefs for the preceding three years after having spent the four seasons before those with the Eagles. He served as a quality control assistant coach for the Eagles in 2009 and 2010 before being promoted to quarterbacks coach for the 2011 and 2012 seasons. He had been praised for his work with Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith over the prior several seasons, particularly 2015, as the Chiefs moved into the top 10 in scoring offense.

They used the second overall pick to draft North Dakota State quarterback Carson Wentz. On September 3, 2016, the Eagles traded starting quarterback Sam Bradford to the Minnesota Vikings, who had lost Teddy Bridgewater for the season, for a 2017 first-round pick and a 2018 fourth-round pick. Following the trade, the Eagles named Wentz the starting quarterback for Week 1 of the 2016 season. First-time head coach Pederson led the Eagles to a 3\u20130 record to start the season. His rookie quarterback started with five touchdowns, no interceptions and over 255 yards per game. After a Week 4 bye, they lost four out of the next five games, including losses to every team in their division. They also lost right tackle Lane Johnson to a 10-game suspension following the Week 5 loss against the Lions, which damaged Carson Wentz's hot start. In those four defeats, their average margin of loss was just under 5 points. Pederson and the Eagles won just three of their final seven games.

In a Week 14 game against the Los Angeles Rams, starting quarterback Carson Wentz left the game with a torn anterior cruciate ligament, and backup Nick Foles, who had been re-signed in the off-season, took over for the rest of the season. Wentz was considered to have been playing at an MVP level at the time of his injury. Foles's first start was a comeback from a 20\u20137 deficit against the New York Giants where he scored four touchdowns to win 34\u201329. Foles struggled in the last two games of the season against the Oakland Raiders and the Dallas Cowboys and threw a touchdown and two interceptions in those two games. The Eagles clinched the #1 seed and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs after the win against Oakland in Week 16. Despite making history by being home underdogs, Foles led the Eagles past the Atlanta Falcons in the Divisional Round 15\u201310.

In the second quarter, Philadelphia faced fourth-and-goal on the 1-yard line with 38 seconds left. Deciding to go for the touchdown, they attempted a trick play similar to one that had failed for the Patriots earlier. It would be the most memorable play of the game. As Foles stepped up to the running back position, Clement took a direct snap and pitched the ball to tight end Trey Burton, who then threw the ball to Foles, who was wide open in the right side of the end zone. Foles caught the ball, making him the first quarterback ever to catch a touchdown pass in a Super Bowl, and the ensuing extra point was good, giving the Eagles a 22\u201312 lead. The scoring play came to be known as the Philly Special. The Eagles went on to win 41\u201333, capturing their first Super Bowl Vince Lombardi Trophy in franchise history and their first championship since 1960, ending the third-longest active championship drought in the NFL at 57 years. Foles won Super Bowl MVP going 28 for 43 with 373 passing yards, three passing touchdowns, one interception, and one receiving touchdown. Foles became the first backup quarterback to start and win a Super Bowl since his opponent Tom Brady won as the backup for Drew Bledsoe in 2002's Super Bowl XXXVI.

Before the 2018 season started, many injuries plagued the team, including quarterback Carson Wentz, who was still recovering from an anterior cruciate ligament injury that he had sustained during the previous season. Nick Foles was named the starting quarterback to begin the season, and helped the team win their opening game against the Atlanta Falcons, 18\u201312. Wentz returned as the starting quarterback in week 3 after Foles had led the team to a 1\u20131 record. Injuries continued to be a major problem throughout the season, especially on defense as Jalen Mills, Ronald Darby, and Rodney McLeod all suffered season-ending injuries. Wentz suffered a fractured vertebra in his back after a week 14 loss to the Dallas Cowboys, and Foles was again named the starter for remainder of the season. The Eagles' 4\u20136 record after 10 games seemed to give them little chance of making the playoffs, but the team managed to win 5 of their last 6, including upsets over the eventual NFC champion Los Angeles Rams and Houston Texans.

Once again, injuries continued to plague the team as almost every offensive starter had suffered an injury throughout the season, and the team fielded 14 different offensive line combinations in 16 games. The team entered the bye week with a 3\u20134\u20131 record and proceeded to lose their next four games. During their week 13 match-up against the Green Bay Packers, rookie quarterback Jalen Hurts entered the game in the third quarter in relief of Wentz after poor play. Hurts would later be named the starting quarterback for the remainder of the season after a career-worst season performance by Wentz. Hurts led the Eagles to a 24\u201321 victory against the New Orleans Saints in week 14.

Nick Sirianni years (2021\u2013present) The Eagles hired former Indianapolis Colts' offensive coordinator Nick Sirianni as their next head coach on January 21, 2021. During the offseason, the Eagles traded starting quarterback Carson Wentz to the Colts for a 2021 third-round draft pick and a 2022 conditional second-round pick. In doing so, Wentz was reunited with Frank Reich, head coach of the Colts who served as the Eagles' offensive coordinator for Wentz's first two years in Philadelphia, including during their Super Bowl-winning season in 2017. The Eagles absorbed a $33.8-million dead-cap hit for trading Wentz. During the 2021 NFL draft, the Eagles selected Heisman Trophy\u2013winning wide receiver DeVonta Smith with the 10th overall pick, and maneuvered around the draft to gain an extra first-round selection in the 2022 NFL draft. Smith was a highly touted prospect out of the University of Alabama, and was the first Heisman winner the Eagles drafted in over fifty years.

When the league reformed into the NFC and AFC in 1970, the Eagles were placed in the NFC East. Logo and uniforms The choice of an eagle as the team mascot honored the insignia of the New Deal program, the National Recovery Administration, which featured a blue eagle as its insignia. For the 1933 and 1934 seasons, the Eagles colors were light blue and yellow. In 1935, they added green to their uniforms and for several decades, their colors were kelly green, silver, and white. In 1954 the Eagles, along with the Baltimore Colts, became the second team ever in the NFL to put a logo on their helmets, with silver wings on a kelly green helmet. In 1969 the team wore two helmet versions: Kelly green with white wings in road games, and white with kelly green wings at home. From 1970 to '73, they wore the white helmets with Kelly green wings exclusively before switching back to Kelly green helmets with silver wings. By 1974, Joseph A. Scirrotto Jr. designed the silver wings within a white outline, and this style on a kelly green helmet became standard for over two decades. From 1948 to 1995, the team logo was an eagle in flight carrying a football in its claws, although from 1969 to 1972, the eagle took on a more stylized look. In 1973, the team's name was added below the eagle, returning to its pre-1969 look.

Both the logo and uniforms were radically altered in 1996, when the primary kelly green color was changed to a darker shade, officially described as \"midnight green\". Silver was practically abandoned, as uniform pants moved to either white or midnight green. The traditional helmet wings were changed to a primarily white color, with silver and black accents. The team's logo combination (the eagle and club name lettering) also changed, with the eagle itself limited to a white (bald eagle) head, drawn in a less realistic, more cartoon-like style, and the lettering changed from calligraphic to block letters. The eagle head is the only NFL logo to \"face left\" which causes the right side of the logo to present a stylized \"E\". Since 1996, the team has made only minor alterations, mostly related to jersey/pants combinations worn during specific games. For example, in 1997, against the San Francisco 49ers, the team wore midnight green jerseys and pants for the first of only two occasions in team history. The second occasion was in 2002, during the final regular season game at Veterans Stadium, a win over the division-rival Washington Redskins. A year later, in the first two games of the 2003 season (both home losses, to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and New England Patriots), the Eagles wore white jerseys with white pants. After that, the white jerseys along with white pants were worn exclusively during preseason games from 2004 to 2011, with the exception of 2007 and 2010.

On both white and green jerseys, black shadows and silver trim were added to both the green and white numbering. The stripe on the pants changed from black-green-black to black-silver-green on the white pants, and from a solid black stripe to one stripe of black, another of silver, with one small white stripe in between for the midnight green pants. The 2003 season also saw the team debut black alternate jerseys, with a green (instead of black) shadow on white numbers, and silver trim. These black jerseys have been worn for two selected home games each season (usually the first home game after a bye week and the season finale). In the 2003 and 2004 regular-season home finales, the team wore the green road pants with the black alternate jerseys, but lost both games. Since then, the Eagles have only worn the black jerseys with the white pants. However, due to the special 75th-anniversary uniforms serving as the \"alternates\" for one game in 2007, the Eagles could not wear the alternate black jersey that season per league rules at the time (alternate uniforms were permitted twice per season but only one can be used). The black jerseys with white pants, however, re-appeared for the 2008 Thanksgiving night game against the Arizona Cardinals. From 2006 to 2013, the Eagles have only worn the alternate black jerseys once a season and for the last November home game, but did not use them in 2007, 2010, and 2011.

The team also started wearing black cleats exclusively in 2004, although the rule was relaxed by the mid-2010s. To celebrate the team's 75th anniversary, the 2007 uniforms featured a 75th-season logo patch on the left shoulder. In addition, the team wore \"throwback\" jerseys in a 2007 game against the Detroit Lions. The yellow and blue jerseys, the same colors found on Philadelphia's city flag, are based on those worn by the Philadelphia Eagles in the team's inaugural season, and had been the same colors used by the Frankford Yellow Jackets franchise prior to its suspension of operations in 1931. The Eagles beat Detroit, 56\u201321. In the 2010 season against the Green Bay Packers, on September 12, 2010, the Eagles wore uniforms similar to the ones that were worn by the 1960 championship team in honor the 50th anniversary of that team. In weeks 4 and 6 of the 2010 season, the Eagles wore their white jerseys in a match-up against the Washington Redskins and Atlanta Falcons, respectively, before reverting to their midnight green jerseys for the rest of their home games.

For the 2014 season, the Eagles officially adopted the \"Elite 51\"-style uniform from Nike. However, they only wore the midnight green jerseys and pants in the second half of that season due to the difficulty of producing their preferred shade of midnight green. In Week 6 of 2014 against the New York Giants, the team introduced black pants to complement their black jerseys, giving them a blackout uniform set. The Eagles won the game 27\u20130. The victory was their first shutout in 18 years. In Week 16 of 2016 (also against the Giants), the Eagles wore a variation of the all-black look as part of the NFL Color Rush program, but with solid black socks as opposed to black with white sanitary socks of the original look. With the exception of 2017 and 2025, the Eagles have regularly worn the all-black uniforms at home against the Giants since the 2014 'blackout' game. The black jerseys/white pants combination was last seen during a preseason road game against the New England Patriots, after which the black jerseys were paired exclusively with the black pants. In 2018, the Eagles' midnight green pants were not worn at all, marking the first such instance since the 1996 rebrand that the Eagles wore only white pants with their primary white or midnight green jerseys.

The all-white look began to be utilized full-time as a road uniform set in 2019 thanks to the NFL's decision to allow teams to wear solid color socks as an alternate look. During Week 10 of the 2021 season, the Eagles paired their white uniforms with the alternate black pants against the Denver Broncos, marking the first time the black pants were paired with a different colored uniform. In 2022, the Eagles unveiled a new black alternate helmet, which would be worn alongside the all-black uniform. In addition, the team announced that throwback Kelly Green uniforms would return as an alternate uniform starting in the 2023 season. The team originally intended to release the uniforms in 2022, but due to production supply issues, the Eagles elected to delay its release to the 2023 season. The Eagles returned to wearing Kelly Green uniforms as the teams alternate, with their debut being in a Week 7 win vs the Miami Dolphins. With the Kelly Green helmet becoming the team's one alternate, the black helmet was temporarily shelved, and the Eagles returned to wearing their primary midnight green helmets with the all-black uniform.

Rivalries Divisional Dallas Cowboys The Eagles and Dallas Cowboys rivalry has been listed among the best and most acrimonious in the NFL. The Eagles won the first game in this rivalry 27\u201325 on September 30, 1960. Dallas leads the all-time series 74\u201358 as of the 2024 season, but in recent years, the series has been close, with each team winning 12 games since 2006. There is considerable hostility between the two teams' fan bases, with incidents such as the 1989 Bounty Bowl. The rivalry has even spilled over into draft weekend, with Cowboys legend Drew Pearson and Eagles legend David Akers exchanging insults at the opposing franchise in 2017 and 2018, respectively. New York Giants The Eagles' rivalry with the New York Giants began in 1933 with the founding of the Eagles and slowly strengthened when both teams came to relative prominence in the 1940s and 1950s.

It is ranked by NFL Network as one of the greatest rivalries of all time, Sports Illustrated ranks it as the fourth best NFL rivalry of all time, and according to ESPN, it is one of the fiercest and most well-known rivalries in the football community. As of the 2024 season, the Eagles lead the all-time series 96\u201389\u20132. Washington Commanders While not as big as the rivalries with the Giants and Cowboys, the Eagles' historical rivalry with the Washington Redskins / Washington Football Team / Washington Commanders has still been fierce. Although the two franchises played in the same division in the Eagles' inaugural 1933 season, their first meeting did not take place until October 21, 1934, during Washington's first year under the Boston Redskins moniker; the Redskins defeated the Eagles 6\u20130 at Fenway Park. Washington currently leads the all-time series 90\u201387\u20136. Since 2010, the rivalry has been very even overall with the Eagles winning 19 of the last 31 matchups. Conference Atlanta Falcons The Eagles lead the Atlanta Falcons 21\u201316\u20131, with a 3\u20131 lead in playoff games.

Interconference Pittsburgh Steelers The Eagles and Pittsburgh Steelers are both located in Pennsylvania and began play in 1933. From that season through 1966, this was a major rivalry for both teams, as both were part of the same division. In 1967 they were placed in separate divisions, but remained in the same conference for three years. In 1970 the Steelers (along with the Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Colts) moved to the American Football Conference, while the Eagles stayed with the rest of the old-line NFL teams in the National Football Conference. As a result, the Eagles and Steelers no longer played each other every year; instead, they are scheduled to meet once every four years in the regular season. The most recent meeting was in 2024 at Lincoln Financial Field, with the Eagles winning 27\u201313. The Steelers have lost eleven straight games on the road against the Eagles dating back to 1966, which was also the start of the Super Bowl era.

Merrill Reese, who joined the Eagles in 1976, is the play-by-play announcer, and former Eagles wide receiver Mike Quick, who replaced offense lineman Stan Walters beginning in 1998, is the color analyst. The post-game show, which has consisted of many Philadelphia sports personalities, as of the 2014 season is hosted by Kevin Riley, a former Eagles linebacker and special-teamer, and Rob Ellis. Riley was the former post-game host for the show on 94 WYSP before the WIP change over; Rob Ellis hosts a weekly show nightly from 6\u201310 on 94.1 WIP-FM. Spanish language broadcasts are on WEMG Mega 105.7FM with Rickie Ricardo on play-by-play, and Oscar Budejen as color commentator.

The last home game that was blacked out on television in the Philadelphia market as a result of not being sold out was against the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday, September 12, 1999, which was Andy Reid's first home game as new head coach of the Eagles. The studies note that, whether the Eagles have winning or losing teams, fans can be counted on to pack the stadium each year. As of August 2008, the team had sold out 71 consecutive games, and 70,000 additional fans were on the Eagles' waiting list for season tickets. Despite finishing with a 6\u201310 record in the 2005 season, the Eagles ranked second in the NFL in merchandise sales, and single-game tickets for the next season were sold out minutes after phone and Internet lines opened. Eagles fans have also been known to chant the famous, \"E-A-G-L-E-S \u2013 Eagles!\" at Flyers, Phillies, and 76ers games when the team is getting blown out late in a game and a loss is inevitable, signifying their displeasure with the given team's performance, and that they are instead putting their hope into the Eagles. Occasionally, travelling Phillies fans may even chant this when the Phillies appear to be a few innings away from an inevitable win on the road as a way to celebrate their team and Philadelphia as a whole.

One week later, during an international friendly pitting the United States against Portugal at Lincoln Financial Field, Lloyd celebrated scoring a goal by doing the \"E-A-G-L-E-S, Eagles!\" chant. The United States ultimately won that match 4\u20130.

Bad behavior Along with their fierce devotion, Eagles fans have a reputation for bad behavior and sports-related violence, especially when the team plays its rivals.

In popular culture The 1976 Philadelphia Eagles season was the subject of the movie Invincible. The movie stars Mark Wahlberg as Vince Papale, a part-time school teacher and diehard Eagles fan who became an Eagles player. The film differs slightly from true events as the selection process was invitation-only, and Papale had at least some previous playing experience. The film Silver Linings Playbook highlights the 2008 Philadelphia Eagles season, and the novel mentions the 2006 team.

    "text": "The run-pass option (RPO) is a type of designed option play in American football in which the offensive team has the ability to either rush or pass the ball depending on the alignment and actions of defensive team. Like the standard read-option, the quarterback is responsible for viewing the actions of a particular defender (the \"read man\") and makes a decision to hand the ball off to their running back depending on how that defender chooses to act after the snap of the ball. However, unlike the read-option, the quarterback is responsible for making a decision regarding whether or not to throw a play-action pass to a receiver running a designed route, rather than simply the decision to keep the ball and run with it. History The run-pass option is a development of the triple option that became popular after a 2009 revision to the NCAA rulebook. This rule change allowed linemen to advance three yards downfield prior to a forward pass being thrown. Previously linemen had been restricted to blocking just one yard downfield on pass plays. The additional downfield blocking greatly assisted the wide receiver's ability to run after the catch. As such, the RPO became a staple of many successful college team playbooks. There were many notable critics of the RPO, including former Alabama Crimson Tide Football head coach Nick Saban. Critics of the RPO's adoption within college football generally argued that the rule changes that enabled the RPO had made the game unbalanced by allowing linemen to block so far downfield on passing plays, which was exacerbated by the failure of referees to properly penalize linemen who blocked too far downfield. Just prior to the 2016 college football season, the NCAA proposed to restore the pre-2009 rule, which would have had the effect of restricting the"

Just prior to the 2016 college football season, the NCAA proposed to restore the pre-2009 rule, which would have had the effect of restricting the efficacy of the RPO, but declined to do so after a large number of coaches expressed their discontent with the proposed rule change. The RPO has since spread beyond college football, becoming a part of professional offenses in the National Football League. By 2018, the RPO had entered the playbooks of NFL teams including the Chicago Bears, Carolina Panthers, and Cincinnati Bengals. Strategy College football In college football, the relatively lax definition of an illegal man downfield allows for RPOs to involve heavy downhill running plays and vertical passing attacks. The extra space downfield that linemen are allowed to advance allows more time for passing plays to develop and allows for linemen to engage with linebackers in order to support a downhill run. NFL In the National Football League, the use of the RPO is more restricted than in college football due to its more stringent criteria for an illegal man downfield penalty. As such, passes tend to be quick-hitting and near the line of scrimmage, and linemen are less able to engage with second-level defenders. Examples There are several run-pass option plays that have become commonplace, even earning adoption in the NFL. One common such RPO involves a slot receiver running a slant route run alongside an inside zone read. == References =="
